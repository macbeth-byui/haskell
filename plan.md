## Fall 2022 PDL - Haskell Concurrency

* Continue studying of Haskell with a new book (1 hour load)
* Improve CSE 382 based on what I have learned (2 hour load)

## 2023 Plan

* Winter - Implement a program (~ 1 hour load unreimbursed)
* Spring - Implement a program (~ 1 hour load unreimbursed)

## Fall 2023 FLF - Learning Functional Programming (with Haskell)

* Create course material - not sure if this will be a class.  It could be a special topics class or it could be a Funcitonal Programming certificate class. It could even be an alternative to the Programming certificate for CS majors.
* Integrate Discrete Math, Data Structures, Networking, Databases, Concurrency, Design, Test
* Implement offsite in Rexburg
* No anticipated costs
